# airline
Airline Services Backend Simulator – Full Plan
1. Project Structure Overview
The goal is to build a full-fledged system that simulates an airline's booking system, including user management, flight bookings, and search capabilities. We'll structure this as an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that is scalable and secure.

We'll break it down into the following key components:

Flight Management: Managing flights (search, availability, booking).

User Management: Customer registration, login, and authentication.

Booking Management: Flight booking, cancellation, and view bookings.

Security: Authentication (JWT tokens, user roles).

Testing & Automation: Unit testing, integration testing, and API testing using Postman.

Deployment: Deploy to AWS EC2 with optional use of AWS RDS for production-grade database.

2. Key Features (MVP)
Flight Search: Ability for users to search for flights based on origin and destination.

Flight Booking: Users can book flights (ensure seats are available).

User Registration: Customers can create accounts and manage their profile.

User Authentication: JWT token-based authentication for secure access.

Flight Cancellation: Users can cancel bookings.

View Bookings: Customers can view their past bookings.

3. Phase-by-Phase Implementation
Phase 1: Initial Setup and Basic Flight Management
Create Spring Boot Project:

Set up a Spring Boot application with dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, H2 Database (or MySQL for production).

Define Models and Database Entities:

Create entities for Flight, Booking, and Customer.

Define relationships between entities (e.g., a booking belongs to a flight, a customer can have multiple bookings).

Set Up Basic Repositories:

Create repositories for each entity using Spring Data JPA (FlightRepository, BookingRepository, CustomerRepository).

Flight Management Service:

Implement a service layer for searching flights based on origin and destination.

Implement booking flights with available seat checks.

Implement flight cancellation.

Flight API Controllers:

Expose REST endpoints to search for flights, book flights, and cancel bookings.

Use @GetMapping, @PostMapping, and @DeleteMapping to handle these requests.

Phase 2: User Management and Authentication
User Registration and Authentication:

Create a User entity with fields like username, email, password, and role.

Implement a registration process with password hashing (using BCrypt).

Set up JWT-based authentication to secure endpoints.

Implement a login API that generates a JWT token upon successful authentication.

Authorization and Role-Based Access:

Define roles like ROLE_USER and ROLE_ADMIN.

Set up role-based access control using Spring Security.

Only authenticated users should be able to make bookings or view their booking history.

User Profile Management:

Allow users to view and update their profile information.

Enable password updates and password reset (optional for MVP).

JWT Authentication:

Implement a JWT filter (JwtTokenFilter) to secure endpoints.

Configure Spring Security to use JWT for user authentication.

Phase 3: Booking Management
View Bookings:

Create an endpoint that allows users to view their current bookings.

Implement logic to retrieve booking data from the database based on the user.

Booking Cancellation:

Allow users to cancel their flight bookings.

Update the flight’s available seat count when a booking is cancelled.

Booking Confirmation and Notifications:

Send a booking confirmation email or notification (optional).

You can later implement email integration via an SMTP service like SendGrid or AWS SES.

Phase 4: Enhancing the System (Advanced Features)
Search Filters:

Add filters for searching flights (e.g., search by departure date, price, and class).

Admin Dashboard (Optional):

Build an admin interface (you can expose REST APIs or integrate with an admin frontend later) for:

Adding/Editing flights.

Viewing all bookings.

Managing user accounts.

Booking Limits and Restrictions:

Implement seat limits per flight (ensure users can’t overbook).

Handle edge cases such as flight overbooking, invalid booking requests, etc.

Payment Integration (Optional):

Integrate a payment gateway (Stripe, PayPal) to handle payments for flight bookings.

Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance
Unit Tests:

Write unit tests for service methods (e.g., booking, flight search).

Use JUnit and Mockito for mocking dependencies in tests.

Integration Tests:

Write integration tests to verify that endpoints are working as expected.

Test the entire workflow from user registration to booking and cancellation.

API Testing:

Use Postman for testing API endpoints manually.

Write Postman test scripts for automated API testing.

Phase 6: Deployment to AWS EC2
Set Up AWS EC2 Instance:

Launch an EC2 instance (e.g., t2.micro for testing).

Install Java (JDK), Maven, and Git on the EC2 instance.

Configure Database:

Set up AWS RDS for a production-grade relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL).

Update application properties to connect to AWS RDS.

Deploy Application:

Package the Spring Boot application (mvn clean package).

Transfer the .jar file to the EC2 instance.

Start the Spring Boot application using java -jar your-app.jar.

Configure Nginx/Apache (Optional):

Configure Nginx or Apache as a reverse proxy (optional, for production-ready setup).

Set Up Security Groups:

Open necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443 for web traffic) in AWS security groups.

4. Post-Deployment Enhancements
Logging and Monitoring:

Set up logging with SLF4J and Logback for better visibility into application behavior.

Integrate with AWS CloudWatch or other monitoring tools.

Error Handling:

Implement a global exception handler for better error management.

Performance Optimizations:

Use caching (e.g., Redis) to improve performance for frequently queried data (e.g., flight searches).

Scalability Considerations:

Explore horizontal scaling on AWS using Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) and Auto Scaling.

5. Final MVP Structure
User Management:

Register, login, and authenticate users with JWT.

Secure the application with role-based access control.

Flight Management:

Search for flights, check availability, and book flights.

Implement flight cancellation and view bookings.

Backend API:

Expose REST APIs for flight booking, searching, user management, and booking management.

Testing:

Unit and integration tests for all service layers.

Postman API automation for manual testing.

Deployment:

Deploy the application to AWS EC2 and use AWS RDS for database storage.
